* Code changes for style, cleanliness, eleganance, or other aesthetic stuff will not be accepted.
* All proposed changes must have a clear problem statement and be based on a real-world scenario. Imagined problems will not be solved.
* Tests are appreciated with all pull requests, but I realize there aren't any in here so help with how this might be tested would be very much appreciated.
